#All the global variables; 
#last_melody_beat: Tracks the last time a melody beat occurred to time the next one.
#last_drum_beat: Tracks the last time a drum beat occurred for the drum animation.
#melody_circle_size: Stores the current size of the melody circle, which animates to simulate a beat.
#drum_circle_size: Stores the size of the drum circles, which also animate with each beat.
#melody_color: Holds the current color of the melody circle, changing with each beat.
#drum_colors: A list of colors for each drum circle, allowing each to be individually colored.
#beat_length: Defines the duration of each beat, typically in milliseconds (e.g., 1000 ms for 1 second).
#drum_positions: Holds the x and y coordinates for each drum circle, used to position them on the screen.
