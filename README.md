 # Introduction

Sensory Music Experience is a project designed to create a calming and engaging musical experience specifically for autistic children. The project combines soothing melodies with nature sounds like rain and birds, aiming to provide a relaxing and repetitive auditory environment. Accompanying the music is an animation featuring a color-changing ball that bounces to the melody, along with four additional balls that bounce to the beat of the drums. This multisensory approach seeks to stimulate and comfort children, leveraging the therapeutic benefits of music and visual patterns.

# Technologies 
The project is created with:

## Programming Languages: 
Python 3.8

## Platforms and Tools: 
TunePad (for music composition)
Processing.org (for animations)

## Libraries:
music21 (for music theory and notation)

## Concepts Applied: 
Music Theory (scales, beats, velocity)
Code Theory (functions, variables, syntax)

## Audio Elements: 
Custom-recorded nature sounds (ocean waves, rain, birds)

# Features

### Calming Music Composition:

Gentle melodies with slow tempos and soft beats.
Repetitive patterns to provide predictability and comfort.
Integration of nature sounds to enhance relaxation.

### Interactive Animation:

Main color-changing ball bouncing to the melody.
Four additional balls bouncing to the drum beats.
Visual synchronization with the music for a cohesive experience.

### User-Centered Design: 

Tailored to the sensory preferences of autistic children.
Combines auditory and visual stimuli for multisensory engagement.

# Launch 

## Prerequisites 

Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
Processing software installed from Processing.org.
TunePad Account

## Launching Tunepad Project 

### Accessing the Song Using the TunePad Link 
1. Open the TunePad Link:

Click on the provided TunePad project link: https://tunepad.com/project/90401
The link will open the TunePad editor with the song code loaded.
Play the Song:

Once the project loads, click the Play button (►) at the top of the editor.
Ensure your speakers or headphones are connected and the volume is adjusted to a comfortable level.
The song will play, incorporating the included code and any embedded sounds.

### Accessing the Song Using the JSON File 
Download the JSON File:

Navigate to the .json file in the GitHub repository in the Tunepad folder.
Click on the file and then click the Download button to save it to your computer.
Import the Project into TunePad:

Visit TunePad.
On the TunePad homepage, click on the Import Project option.
Select the .json file you downloaded.
Load Recorded Sounds:

In TunePad, upload the recorded sounds:
Click on the Files tab on the left sidebar.
Click Upload Files and select the sound files from the sounds folder.
The sounds will be added to your project and accessible within the code.
Play the Song:

With the project and sounds loaded, click the Play button (►) to run the code.

### Running the Animation (Processing.org) 
Download the Animation Files:

Download the animation file and any associated files from the animation folder in the repository.
Open the Animation in Processing:

Launch the Processing IDE on your computer.
Open the animation.pde file within the program
Play the Animation:

Click the Run button (►) at the top of the Processing tab.
The animation window will open, displaying the bouncing balls synchronized with the music.

# Project Status 
Current Status: In Development

### Planned enhancements: 

#### Additional Musical Pieces: 

Composing new songs with different moods, such as "Joyful Jump" and "Nature's Melody."

#### Improved Synchronization for animation: 

I will develop further code to create more balls for each layer of the music and different shapes for the nature sounds.

# Sources 
### This project was inspired and informed by: 
This project was inspired by my work as an NDIS worker supporting autistic children. Through my interactions, I've observed that repetitive music and nature sounds like rain and birds can have a calming and engaging effect. These experiences motivated me to create the song, aiming to provide a soothing auditory and visual experience that could benefit children with similar sensory preferences.
