 # SensoryMusicExperience

 # Introduction

Sensory Music Experience is a project designed to create a calming and engaging musical experience specifically for autistic children. The project combines soothing melodies with nature sounds like rain and birds, aiming to provide a relaxing and repetitive auditory environment. Accompanying the music is an animation featuring a colour-changing ball that bounces to the melody, along with four additional balls that bounce to the beat of the drums. This multisensory approach seeks to stimulate and comfort children, leveraging the therapeutic benefits of music and visual patterns.

# General Information
### Project Overview
This project is a code-based sensory experience designed specifically for children with autism to create a calming, supportive environment. By integrating soothing music, ambient nature sounds, and rhythmic animations, the project seeks to provide sensory relief and comfort for children who may experience sensory overload.

### Problem and Purpose
Children with autism can be particularly sensitive to sensory stimuli, and they may experience anxiety or distress when exposed to overwhelming environments. This project aims to address that issue by offering a carefully crafted, multisensory experience that focuses on predictable patterns and soothing auditory and visual elements. The goal is to reduce sensory stress and provide a tool that families, educators, or therapists can use to support sensory-sensitive children in calming down and staying focused.

# Technologies 
The project is created with:

## Programming Languages: 
* Python 3.8 - TunePad
* Python 2.7 - Processing.org

## Platforms and Tools: 
* TunePad (for music composition)
* Processing.org (for animations)
* Google Scholar and UTS Canva for general educational resources on coding and concepts

## Libraries:
*Tunepad Programming Reference (for music theory and notation)
*(Can be accessed through the "Help" button on Tunepad)

## Concepts Applied: 
* Music Theory (scales, beats, velocity)
* Code Theory (functions, variables, syntax)
* Modularity in Coding: Structuring code in layers or modules
* Animation Synchronization: Synchronizing visuals (colourful bouncing ball) with audio
* Accessibility in Design: Designing with sensory sensitivity in mind
* Applying data types (e.g., integers for beats) and control structures (loops) to manage the timing

## Audio Elements: 
Custom-recorded nature sounds (ocean waves, rain, birds)

# Features

### Calming Music Composition:

Gentle melodies with slow tempos and soft beats.
Repetitive patterns to provide predictability and comfort.
Integration of nature sounds to enhance relaxation.

### Interactive Animation:

Main color-changing ball bouncing to the melody.
Four additional balls bouncing to the drum beats.
Visual synchronization with the music for a cohesive experience.

### User-Centered Design: 

Tailored to the sensory preferences of autistic children.
Combines auditory and visual stimuli for multisensory engagement.

# Setup 

## Prerequisites 

* Processing software installed from Processing.org.
* TunePad Account and download the JSON and music files Located in github Tunepad Folder
* Processing Files downloaded from the Processing Folder

# Usage

## Launching Tunepad Project 

### Option 1: Accessing the Song Using the TunePad Link 
* Open the TunePad Link:
* Click on the provided TunePad project link: https://tunepad.com/project/90401
* The link will open the TunePad editor with the song code loaded.
* Play the Song: Once the project loads, click the Play button (►) at the top of the editor.
* Ensure your speakers or headphones are connected and the volume is adjusted to a comfortable level.
* The song will play, incorporating the included code and any embedded sounds.

### Option 2: Accessing the Song Using the JSON File 
Download the JSON File:

* Navigate to the .json file and music files in the GitHub repository in the Tunepad folder.
* Click on the file and then click the Download button to save it to your computer.
* Import the Project into TunePad:
* Visit https://tunepad.com
* On the TunePad homepage, click on the Import Project option.
* Select the .json file you downloaded.
  
#### Load Recorded Sounds:

In TunePad, upload the recorded sounds:
*Click on the Files tab on the left sidebar.
*Click Upload Files and select the sound files from the sounds folder.
*The sounds will be added to your project and accessible within the code.
*With the project and sounds loaded, click the Play button (►) to run the code.

### Running the Animation (Processing.org) 
*Download the Animation Files:
* Download the animation file and any associated files from the animation folder in the repository.
* Open the Animation in Processing:
* Open the .pde file within the program
* Play the Animation: Click the Run button (►) at the top of the Processing tab.
*The animation window will open, displaying the bouncing balls synchronized with the music.

# Project Status 
Current Status: In Development

### Planned enhancements: 

#### Additional Musical Pieces: 

Composing new songs with different moods, such as "Joyful Jump" and "Nature's Melody."

#### Improved Synchronization for animation: 

I will develop further code to create more balls for each layer of the music and different shapes for the nature sounds.

# Sources 
### This project was inspired and informed by: 
This project was inspired by my work as an NDIS worker supporting autistic children. Through my interactions, I've researched and observed that repetitive music and nature sounds like rain and birds can have a calming and engaging effect according to Wigram and Gold (2006). These experiences motivated me to create the song, aiming to provide a soothing auditory and visual experience that could benefit children with similar sensory preferences.
