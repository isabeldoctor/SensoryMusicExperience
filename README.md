# SensoryMusicExperience

Introduction # Heading 1

Sensory Music Experience is a project designed to create a calming and engaging musical experience specifically for autistic children. The project combines soothing melodies with nature sounds like rain and birds, aiming to provide a relaxing and repetitive auditory environment. Accompanying the music is an animation featuring a color-changing ball that bounces to the melody, along with four additional balls that bounce to the beat of the drums. This multisensory approach seeks to stimulate and comfort children, leveraging the therapeutic benefits of music and visual patterns.

Launch # header H1

Prerequisites # header H2

Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
Processing software installed from Processing.org.
TunePad Account

Launching Tunepad Project # header H2

Accessing the Song Using the TunePad Link # header H3
1. Open the TunePad Link:

Click on the provided TunePad project link: https://tunepad.com/project/90401
The link will open the TunePad editor with the song code loaded.
Play the Song:

Once the project loads, click the Play button (►) at the top of the editor.
Ensure your speakers or headphones are connected and the volume is adjusted to a comfortable level.
The song will play, incorporating the included code and any embedded sounds.

Accessing the Song Using the JSON File # header H3
Download the JSON File:

Navigate to the .json file in the GitHub repository in the Tunepad folder.
Click on the file and then click the Download button to save it to your computer.
Import the Project into TunePad:

Visit TunePad.
On the TunePad homepage, click on the Import Project option.
Select the .json file you downloaded.
Load Recorded Sounds:

In TunePad, upload the recorded sounds:
Click on the Files tab on the left sidebar.
Click Upload Files and select the sound files from the sounds folder.
The sounds will be added to your project and accessible within the code.
Play the Song:

With the project and sounds loaded, click the Play button (►) to run the code.

Running the Animation (Processing.org) # header H3
Download the Animation Files:

Download the animation file and any associated files from the animation folder in the repository.
Open the Animation in Processing:

Launch the Processing IDE on your computer.
Open the animation.pde file within the program
Play the Animation:

Click the Run button (►) at the top of the Processing tab.
The animation window will open, displaying the bouncing balls synchronized with the music.

Project Status # header H1
Current Status: In Development

Planned enhancements: # header H3

Additional Musical Pieces: # header H4

Composing new songs with different moods, such as "Joyful Jump" and "Nature's Melody."

Improved Synchronization for animation: # header H4

I will develop further code to create more balls for each layer of the music and different shapes for the nature sounds.

Sources # header H1
This project was inspired and informed by: # header H3
This project was inspired by my work as an NDIS worker supporting autistic children. Through my interactions, I've observed that repetitive music and nature sounds like rain and birds can have a calming and engaging effect. These experiences motivated me to create the song, aiming to provide a soothing auditory and visual experience that could benefit children with similar sensory preferences.
